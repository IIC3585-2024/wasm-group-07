# Prime Factorization Benchmark


> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using Brave to see this benchmark, you may notice that the time associated to each prime factorization is always an integer. This happens because Brave has some flags for certain features. To disable this you need to open ![Brave Flags](brave://flags) and search for the Round time stamps flag. Now you should be able to see much percise times when running this benchmark.
